<h2>About ProtonMail:</h2><p>ProtonMail is a free and private email provider. Emails sent between ProtonMail users are encrypted end-to-end, and ProtonMail cannot access any emails sent. This end-to-end encryption also protects you against Meddler in the Middle attacks (MitM), so hackers can’t easily intercept and snoop your emails<br/></p><h2>Things to Know About ProtonMail:</h2><ol><li>Although emails are encrypted end-to-end, metadata about the emails (such as subject lines, and sender &amp; recipient) is stored by ProtonMail.</li><li>Emails sent between ProtonMail users are encrypted, but users sent between ProtonMail and non-ProtonMail users are not encrypted in transit. This means that if the (non-ProtonMail) recipient’s inbox gets breached, all of the emails will be visible by default. This can be remedied by using the encryption features, or PGP.</li><li>Although ProtonMail is more private than mainstream email providers (gmail, hotmail etc.), and safer against hackers, it will not protect you against government agencies. ProtonMail will help you regain some privacy online, but won’t help you hide your firearm smuggling/money laundering business. Sorry</li></ol><h2>Setting up a ProtonMail Account:</h2><p>To create a ProtonMail account, go to <a href="https://protonmail.com/signup">protonmail.com/signup</a>, where you can select what tier of membership you want. The more expensive tiers have their advantages, but for most people the free account is more than plenty. After selecting the tier, you’ll be taken to the following page:</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="949" data-orig-width="612"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/e428e996810491f65d88543d048303a8/85f4da4845554a45-45/s540x810/ee3ab1c53de4df18f00967f914f9810baeb43f1b.png" data-orig-height="949" data-orig-width="612"/></figure><p>You can then choose a username, as well as the domain you want. You can choose between a .com or .ch email address. You’ll see this while it sets up your account:</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="422" data-orig-width="661"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/61e617e91626cb8d2c68f83b563246f8/85f4da4845554a45-82/s540x810/39a1e7b19609ed0a04ea3ee1d2b25cfbc93270a8.png" data-orig-height="422" data-orig-width="661"/></figure><p>Once it’s finished creating your account, you’ll be able to set a screen name to be displayed to others when they receive an email from you.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="577" data-orig-width="768"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a36a802eedc589a4a58d6320b5f0474b/85f4da4845554a45-0d/s540x810/983a1a6fce93d841b4398b41acfad5195893f074.png" data-orig-height="577" data-orig-width="768"/></figure><p>And with that, your account is set up!</p><h2>How to Use ProtonMail:</h2><p>Despite sounding technical with encryption and all that, it really seems like any other email client. The inbox is very similar to something like gmail.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1006" data-orig-width="1858"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/542eee9a76506c51729b0c50e10be652/85f4da4845554a45-14/s540x810/728a80d9f91f80657fe5aaec212c9d45334353a2.png" data-orig-height="1006" data-orig-width="1858"/></figure><p>I think the only thing I really need to explain is the encryption. As mentioned before, emails sent between ProtonMail users are encrypted end-to-end, but anything sent between a ProtonMail and non-ProtonMail user will not be encrypted by default. Luckily you have an option to encrypt messages sent over ProtonMail. Clicking ‘Compose’ will show a pop-up like this:</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="511" data-orig-width="601"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a34859c001d1b885ca4a3bc7a09921d4/85f4da4845554a45-22/s540x810/de2c43e6586ddb7e79995ba6b065eb108fa092c4.png" data-orig-height="511" data-orig-width="601"/></figure><p>brb while I write an email.</p><p>Ok, I’m back</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="511" data-orig-width="600"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/9dc11af49637f5a5170f14344bb14025/85f4da4845554a45-de/s540x810/e09b08bdd702131da66c00a29ee493e011f05a54.png" data-orig-height="511" data-orig-width="600"/></figure><p>Now, to encrypt it I click the padlock button on the bottom left. This will lock the email, and require a password to open, as well as scrambling it so hackers can’t read it.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="511" data-orig-width="600"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ec1b1aac48e8dd7f1fad67332a4df0a2/85f4da4845554a45-cd/s540x810/29cc368917a6f51d837c6745e07d50e6852ad894.png" data-orig-height="511" data-orig-width="600"/></figure><p>I’ve encrypted this with a password of “UncrackablePassword”(Note: This is not a very secure password. For any sensitive emails, <i>please</i> use a more secure password). I click ‘Set’, then I send my first encrypted password!<br/></p><p>Now the spy logs into their email address. This is what they see:</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="829" data-orig-width="1092"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/57ed6eff7578aeeb51d53e3da717186b/85f4da4845554a45-34/s540x810/e26a48e9a20f4a9984f52782d84366f4aeaba744.png" data-orig-height="829" data-orig-width="1092"/></figure><p>In order to view the email, they need to click the link and enter their password. Doing so reveals the email:<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="285" data-orig-width="1658"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/adb5ecb7bb027b873072490d85417483/85f4da4845554a45-a7/s540x810/726547e15831498a93584c15c140e1bcee358f2c.png" data-orig-height="285" data-orig-width="1658"/></figure><h2>Conclusion:<br/></h2><p>Hopefully you know know how to create and use a ProtonMail account. Remember to bear in mind the things I told you before. ProtonMail may be good, but it isn’t unbreakable<br/></p><p>(This post isn’t an ad or sponsored in any way, I just like their service. That being said if anyone at ProtonMail wants to sponsor me, you know my email)</p>

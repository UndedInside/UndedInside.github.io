<p>When discussing privacy online a common suggestion is to use
a VPN or a proxy with the assertion that it will protect your privacy, but if
you are like me you may not know how either works or even that there is a
difference between the two. In this post I will teach you what they are, and
how they are different to each other.</p><h2>What is a Proxy?</h2><p>You can think of a proxy as a ‘go-between’ that sits between
your machine and the server you want to connect to (I’m going to use a
webserver for this example, but it could be anything). When you want to
interact with the website, you send the requests through the proxy server which
sends them to the website. The proxy server then receives the result from the
webserver and sends it back to you.  This
hides your IP address, as the webserver only sees the IP address of the proxy
server, not of your machine.</p><figure data-orig-width="601" data-orig-height="61" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/afe3515e233e1114c6c4c038a7a32b7d/20eb1ff2991cdfbb-52/s540x810/055ac127a0ecf086ed80f30575f4e270e3bab9a8.png" data-orig-width="601" data-orig-height="61"/></figure><h2>How is a VPN Different to a Proxy?</h2><p>A VPN is also a ‘go-between’, but this time the data you
send between the VPN and the proxy is encrypted (data sent between the VPN
server and the webserver are not necessarily encrypted). A VPN also hides your
IP address, as well as hiding your browsing from people on the same network
using packet sniffers, which a proxy does not. </p><figure data-orig-width="601" data-orig-height="61" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c548c8a1e097c5c04bb424844cf6060a/20eb1ff2991cdfbb-12/s540x810/6f9ae16f54e8c7513639680fab9da34bf6da3c38.png" data-orig-width="601" data-orig-height="61"/></figure>
